Some notes on running test programs on Didi UUB

* IP of Didi UUB is 172.21.3.51

* Connect from the OB wireless network

* Use telnet and ftp to connect and transfer files

* Username is "root", password is "root"

* Might need to run the command "/etc/init.d/inetd.busybox restart" to get
  ftp server on the uub to behave.

* When cross-compiling test code, need to run from setup_vivado window

* Make sure to export design to sdk after compile or header files may not
  be correct for test programs.

* To load new bitstream, 
  1) transfer bitstream file to uub using ftp
  2) run "mountboot" command on uub
  3) copy bitstream file to /boot/fpga.bit
  4) run "sync" command on uub
  5) run "reboot" command on uub

* If need to install new software on laptop and have trouble reaching yum
  repositories after doing a "su", may need to do the command
  "export http_proxy=http://proxy.auger.org.ar:8080"
